        <p>
            Programan is not a hero we wanted, but thee hero we needed.
            He thinks in binary and can compile and write anything in any
            language. Memory allocation with C? Easy. Java classes? Easy.
            Javascript horrors? Easy. His only weakness is Swift - Apple
            gatekeeps it way too much.
